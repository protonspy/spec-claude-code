<!-- rtk-instructions v2 -->
## RTK
Prefix EVERY command with `rtk`, including each link in a `&&` chain (`rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "x"`).
No dedicated filter means it passes through unchanged — always safe.

Covered:
- cargo build/check/clippy/test, go test, tsc, lint, prettier, next build
- jest, vitest, playwright, pytest, rspec, rake test, test `<cmd>`
- git (all subcommands)
- gh pr view/checks, gh run list, gh issue list, gh api
- pnpm, npm run, npx, prisma, uv run
- ls, read, grep, find
- err, log, json, deps, env, summary, diff
- docker, kubectl, curl, wget

Meta: `rtk gain [--history]`, `rtk discover`, `rtk proxy <cmd>` (no filtering), `rtk init [--global]`
Caveat: `rtk grep` with `-c -l -L -o -Z` runs raw.
